      <description>I have been trying to start blogging for a long time now. I wanted a website that was managed by me to publish my blog. Managing my own website would mean investing time in writing HTML, JS and CSS files as well. I thought it be cool if I can publish blogs without leaving my editor, and don&amp;rsquo;t have to write markup and styling.
I wanted the blog to be more about writing rather than managing the post.</description>

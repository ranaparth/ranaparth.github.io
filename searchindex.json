Managing my own website would mean investing time in writing HTML, JS and CSS files as well. I thought it be cool if I can publish blogs without leaving my editor, and don\u0026rsquo;t have to write markup and styling.\nI wanted the blog to be more about writing rather than managing the post. I thought writing a post in markdown would be simple, as most of the time I am on an editor/terminal. I can write, commit \u0026amp; push for publishing a new post.\nI was also a bit concerned about hosting the site. Maintaing a separate server would mean I had to invest some time and capital. I found Github Pages to be a simple solution for someone starting a blog. As I already use GitHub for my projects, pushing blog changes would as simple as pushing my code.\nI just wanted the tool to be simple and support markdown. I found Hugo and Jekyll. Both are static site generators. Static site generator is a tool (or set of tools) for building webpage with fixed content, based on a set of input files. Both of them provide support for writing in markdown. Jekyll has a built-in support for GitHub Pages. But I went with Hugo. I found Hugo much faster than Jekyll plus it’s written in golang (what’s not to love).\nHugo is fast, simple \u0026amp; performant. For starting a blog, I thought it would be best. I started by installing Hugo. I followed the quickstart guide on the Hugo blog. I wrote this article to test the rendering of the blog.\nIn the coming weeks, I am thinking of forking out the current theme repository and adjust it to my requirements. I will try to write another detailed post on each step involved in creating this blog.\n","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"I have been trying to start blogging for a long time now.

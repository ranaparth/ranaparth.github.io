I thought it would be easy if I can publish blogs writing markdown files.\nFew things that I was concerned about:\n  Capital — I wanted the investment to be minimum. Didn’t wanted to manage a server or traffic on the site. I found Github pages to be a simple solution for someone starting a blog. As I already use GitHub for my projects, pushing blog changes would as simple as pushing my code.\n  Time — I wanted the content to be more about writing rather than managing the post. I thought writing a post in markdown would be simple as most of the time I am on an editor/terminal. I can write, commit \u0026amp; push for publishing a new post.\n  Content Management — I just wanted the support of markdown and the tool to be simple. I found Hugo and Jekyll. Both are static site generators. Both of them provide support for writing in markdown. Jekyll is already used by Github pages. But I went with Hugo. I found Hugo much faster than Jekyll plus it’s written in golang (what’s not to love).\n  Hugo is fast, simple \u0026amp; performant. For starting a blog, I thought it would be best. I started by installing Hugo. I followed the quickstart guide on the Hugo blog. Finalized ‘pure’ theme. I wrote this article to test the rendering of the blog.\nIn the coming weeks, I am thinking of forking out the current theme repo and adjust it to my requirements. I will try to write another detailed post on each step involved in creating this blog.\n","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure of starting a blog at first.
